- I tried theysaidso api but there random quote api is paid
- zenquotes api was having cors issues. I tried calling some other api with same code, it was working, however zenquotes didn't. I believe zenquotes don't allow  localhost,ipaddress instead of domain name or from a non Https server, 
- I tried same api with postman it was working. but somehow it was blocking my origin
